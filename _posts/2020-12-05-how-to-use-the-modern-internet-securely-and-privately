Having grown up with the internet, and watched as it has matured in the Web 2.0 era, I have developed a keen interest in the tools that can help individuals use the internet securely and privately in a time when it is now widely considered a basic utility that everyone must use for all aspects of their lives. But, as we have seen, many of the web services that have been built on top of the internet have become increasingly centralised. The most popular services are controlled by a few corporations that now have access to the private information of a vast number of people. Yes, the majority of people do not care that they are trading their personal information in exchange for "free" use of web services. But it doesn't have to be this way.
