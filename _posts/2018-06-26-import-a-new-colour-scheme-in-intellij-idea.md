This tutorial assumes you have already exported a colour scheme from Intellij IDEA in the .jar format.

In IntelliJ IDEA navigate to 'Preferences' -&gt; 'Editor' -&gt; 'Color Scheme', click on the cog icon and then click 'Import Scheme' -&gt; and then 'Intellij IDEA color scheme (.icls) or settings (.jar)'.

Select the .jar file and submit. IntelliJ IDEA should apply the imported colour scheme automatically, but if it doesn't, ensure it is the select scheme, and try restarted IntelliJ.
