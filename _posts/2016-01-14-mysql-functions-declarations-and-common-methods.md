The following is a reference implementation of a function declaration and explanation of common method usages.

This example function can be used to capitalize the first letter of each word in a String and add a full-stop to the end of the String if one doesn't already exist.

Note: The main difference between functions and procedures are their usage:

    A stored routine is either a procedure or a function.

    A procedure is invoked using a CALL statement and can only pass back values using output variables.

    A function can be called from inside a statement just like any other function and can return a scalar value.

    A function can return only 1 value, where a procedure can return up to a maximum of 1024 values or non at all.
